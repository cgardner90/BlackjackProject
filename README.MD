# How to Play
A player starts the game, where a deck is created, two players ( Dealer and Player ) are input into the game, and cards are dealt. Automatic checks for blackjack are conducted before a player even makes a decision or sees their cards, as this is a game ending occurance. The player can choose to hit or stay based on their score, and when their turn is over, the dealer goes automaticall. The BlackJack dealer makes it's decisions based on programmed rules for BlackJack, following code specific to the "Dealer" object.
